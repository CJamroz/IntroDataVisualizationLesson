# Introduction to Data Science Lesson on Data Visualization
The Jupyter notebook (with possible answers to Problems removed) was provided to students for an introductory lesson on data visualization.  Students had previously seen this dataset during a lesson on cleaning data, and the first seven input cells contain code we wrote during that lesson, included as review.  The lesson consists of some content and provided code, along with practice problems for students to work on during class time.
